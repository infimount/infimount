## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Infimount seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please do NOT open an issue.

Instead, please report it via email to **security@infimount.org** (or **rajan.kadeval@gmail.com** until a dedicated address is set up).

We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide an estimated timeframe for a fix. We ask that you give us a reasonable amount of time to patch the vulnerability before disclosing it to the public.

Thank you for helping keep Infimount safe!
