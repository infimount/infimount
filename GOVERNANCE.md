# Infimount Governance

This document describes the governance model for the Infimount project.

## Overview

Infimount is governed by a **Technical Steering Committee (TSC)** that makes decisions about the project's technical direction, releases, and community standards.

## Roles

### Contributors
Anyone who contributes to Infimount (code, documentation, issues, reviews) is a **Contributor**. Contributors are the lifeblood of the project.

### Committers
**Committers** are Contributors who have demonstrated sustained, high-quality contributions and have been granted write access to the repository. Committers can:
- Merge pull requests (with approval)
- Triage issues
- Review code

### Maintainers
**Maintainers** are Committers who have taken on additional responsibility for the project's overall health. Maintainers can:
- Approve and merge pull requests
- Make release decisions
- Vote on TSC matters
- Mentor new contributors

### TSC Members
The **Technical Steering Committee** consists of Maintainers who guide the project's direction. TSC responsibilities include:
- Setting technical direction and roadmap
- Resolving disputes
- Managing releases
- Maintaining community standards

## Decision Making

### Lazy Consensus
Most decisions are made through **lazy consensus**:
1. A proposal is made (issue, PR, or discussion)
2. If no objections are raised within 72 hours, the proposal is accepted
3. Silence is interpreted as agreement

### Voting
For significant decisions (breaking changes, new Maintainers, governance changes), a formal vote may be called:
- Each TSC member has one vote
- Decisions require a simple majority
- Voting period is 7 days
- Abstentions do not count toward the total

## Becoming a Maintainer

To become a Maintainer:
1. Demonstrate sustained, high-quality contributions over 3+ months
2. Show good judgment in code reviews and issue triage
3. Be nominated by an existing Maintainer
4. Receive approval from the TSC (lazy consensus)

## Code of Conduct

All participants must follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Amendments

This governance document may be amended by a TSC vote with a 2/3 majority.
